# My Gutenberg Plugin

This is a starter template for a WordPress Gutenberg plugin that displays "Hello World" within the block editor. It is intended to serve as a foundation for developers to build their own Gutenberg blocks and features a simple, understandable structure.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
